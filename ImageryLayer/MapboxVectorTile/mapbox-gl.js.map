the strategies for constructing,\r\n *  uploading, and binding paint property data as GLSL attributes.\r\n *\r\n *  It has three implementations, one for each of the three strategies we use:\r\n *\r\n *  * For _constant_ properties -- those whose value is a constant, or the constant\r\n *    result of evaluating a camera expression at a particular camera position -- we\r\n *    don't need a vertex buffer, and instead use a uniform.\r\n *  * For data expressions, we use a vertex buffer with a single attribute value,\r\n *    the evaluated result of the source function for the given feature.\r\n *  * For composite expressions, we use a vertex buffer with two attributes: min and\r\n *    max values covering the range of zooms at which we expect the tile to be\r\n *    displayed. These values are calculated by evaluating the composite expression for\r\n *    the given feature at strategically chosen zoom levels.

exponential function\r\n * stops.\r\n * How it works: Two consecutive stop values define a (scaled and shifted) exponential function `f(x) = a * base^x + b`, where `base` is the user-specified base,\r\n * and `a` and `b` are constants affording sufficient degrees of freedom to fit\r\n * the function to the given stops.\r\n *\r\n * Here's a bit of algebra that lets us compute `f(x)` directly from the stop\r\n * values without explicitly solving for `a` and `b`:\r\n *\r\n * First stop value: `f(x0) = y0 = a * base^x0 + b`\r\n * Second stop value: `f(x1) = y1 = a * base^x1 + b`\r\n * => `y1 - y0 = a(base^x1 - base^x0)`\r\n * => `a = (y1 - y0)/(base^x1 - base^x0)`\r\n *\r\n * Desired value: `f(x) = y = a * base^x + b`\r\n * => `f(x) = y0 + a * (base^x - base^x0)`\r\n *\r\n * From the

WorkerTile#parse(), the logical owner of the bucket creation process,\r\n *    calls SymbolBucket#populate(), which resolves text and icon tokens on\r\n *    each feature, adds each glyphs and symbols needed to the passed-in\r\n *    collections options.glyphDependencies and options.iconDependencies, and\r\n *    stores the feature data for use in subsequent step (this.features).\r\n *\r\n * 2. WorkerTile asynchronously requests from the main thread all of the glyphs\r\n *    and icons needed (by this bucket and any others). When glyphs and icons\r\n *    have been received, the WorkerTile creates a CollisionIndex and invokes:\r\n *\r\n * 3. performSymbolLayout(bucket, stacks, icons) perform texts shaping and\r\n *    layout on a Symbol Bucket. This step populates:\r\n *      `this.symbolInstances`: metadata on generated symbols\r\n *      `this.collisionBoxArray`: collision data for use by foreground\r\n *      `this.text`: SymbolBuffers for text symbols\r\n *      `this.icons`: SymbolBuffers for icons\r\n *      `this.collisionBox`: Debug SymbolBuffers for collision boxes\r\n *      `this.collisionCircle`: Debug SymbolBuffers for collision circles\r\n *    The results are sent to the foreground for rendering\r\n *\r\n * 4. performSymbolPlacement(bucket, collisionIndex) is run on the foreground,\r\n *    and uses the CollisionIndex along with current camera settings to determine\r\n *    which symbols can actually show on the map. Collided symbols are hidden\r\n *    using a dynamic \"OpacityVertexArray\".\r\n *\r\n * @private\r\n */\r\nclass SymbolBucket implements Bucket {\r\n    static MAX_GLYPHS: number;\r\n    static

Some labels have corresponding line geometries.\r\n * The points for both anchors and lines are stored in tile units.

This must be an a JSON object conforming to\r\n * the schema described in the [Mapbox Style Specification](https://mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/), or a URL to\r\n * such JSON.\r\n *\r\n * To load a style from the Mapbox API, you can use a URL of the form `mapbox://styles/:owner/:style`,\r\n * where `:owner` is your Mapbox account name and `:style` is the style ID. Or you can use one of the following\r\n * [the predefined Mapbox styles](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/):\r\n *\r\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9`\r\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/outdoors-v9`\r\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v9`\r\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9`\r\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v9`\r\n *  * `mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-streets-v9`\r\n *\r\n * Tilesets hosted with Mapbox can be style-optimized if you append `?optimize=true` to the end of your style URL, like `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9?optimize=true`.\r\n * Learn more about style-optimized vector tiles in our [API documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#retrieve-tiles).\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.hash=false] If `true`, the map's position (zoom, center latitude, center longitude, bearing, and pitch) will be synced with the hash fragment of the page's URL.\r\n *   For example, `http://path/to/my/page.html#2.59/39.26/53.07/-24.1/60`.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.interactive=true] If `false`, no mouse, touch, or keyboard listeners will be attached to the map, so it will not respond to interaction.\r\n * @param {number} [options.bearingSnap=7] The threshold, measured in degrees, that determines when the map's\r\n *   bearing will snap to north. For example, with a `bearingSnap` of 7, if the user rotates\r\n *   the map within 7 degrees of north, the map will automatically snap to exact north.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.pitchWithRotate=true] If `false`, the map's pitch (tilt) control with \"drag to rotate\" interaction will be disabled.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.attributionControl=true] If `true`, an {@link AttributionControl} will be added to the map.\r\n * @param {string} [options.logoPosition='bottom-left'] A string representing the position of the Mapbox wordmark on the map. Valid options are `top-left`,`top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat=false] If `true`, map creation will fail if the performance of Mapbox\r\n *   GL JS would be dramatically worse than expected (i.e. a software renderer would be used).\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.preserveDrawingBuffer=false] If `true`, the map's canvas can be exported to a PNG using `map.getCanvas().toDataURL()`. This is `false` by default as a performance optimization.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.refreshExpiredTiles=true] If `false`, the map won't attempt to re-request tiles once they expire per their HTTP `cacheControl`/`expires` headers.\r\n * @param {LngLatBoundsLike} [options.maxBounds] If set, the map will be constrained to the given bounds.\r\n * @param {boolean|Object} [options.scrollZoom=true] If `true`, the \"scroll to zoom\" interaction is enabled. An `Object` value is passed as options to {@link ScrollZoomHandler#enable}.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.boxZoom=true] If `true`, the \"box zoom\" interaction is enabled (see {@link BoxZoomHandler}).\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragRotate=true] If `true`, the \"drag to rotate\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DragRotateHandler}).\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.dragPan=true] If `true`, the \"drag to pan\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DragPanHandler}).\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.keyboard=true] If `true`, keyboard shortcuts are enabled (see {@link KeyboardHandler}).\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.doubleClickZoom=true] If `true`, the \"double click to zoom\" interaction is enabled (see {@link DoubleClickZoomHandler}).\r\n * @param {boolean|Object} [options.touchZoomRotate=true] If `true`, the \"pinch to rotate and zoom\" interaction is enabled. An `Object` value is passed as options to {@link TouchZoomRotateHandler#enable}.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.trackResize=true]  If `true`, the map will automatically resize when the browser window resizes.\r\n * @param {LngLatLike} [options.center=[0, 0]] The inital geographical centerpoint of the map. If `center` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `[0, 0]` Note: Mapbox GL uses longitude, latitude coordinate order (as opposed to latitude, longitude) to match GeoJSON.\r\n * @param {number} [options.zoom=0] The initial zoom level of the map. If `zoom` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\r\n * @param {number} [options.bearing=0] The initial bearing (rotation) of the map, measured in degrees counter-clockwise from north. If `bearing` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\r\n * @param {number} [options.pitch=0] The initial pitch (tilt) of the map, measured in degrees away from the plane of the screen (0-60). If `pitch` is not specified in the constructor options, Mapbox GL JS will look for it in the map's style object. If it is not specified in the style, either, it will default to `0`.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.renderWorldCopies=true]  If `true`, multiple copies of the world will be rendered, when zoomed out.\r\n * @param {number} [options.maxTileCacheSize=null]  The maxiumum number of tiles stored in the tile cache for a given source. If omitted, the cache will be dynamically sized based on the current viewport.\r\n * @param {string} [options.localIdeographFontFamily=null] If specified, defines a CSS font-family\r\n *   for locally overriding generation of glyphs in the 'CJK Unified Ideographs' and 'Hangul Syllables' ranges.\r\n *   In these ranges, font settings from the map's style will be ignored, except for font-weight keywords (light/regular/medium/bold).\r\n *   The purpose of this option is to avoid bandwidth-intensive glyph server requests. (see [Use locally generated ideographs](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/local-ideographs))\r\n * @param {RequestTransformFunction} [options.transformRequest=null] A callback run before the Map makes a request for an external URL. The callback can be used to modify the url, set headers, or set the credentials property for cross-origin requests.\r\n *   Expected to return an object with a `url` property and optionally `headers` and `credentials` properties.\r\n * @example\r\n * var map = new mapboxgl.Map({\r\n *   container: 'map',\r\n *   center: [-122.420679, 37.772537],\r\n *   zoom: 13,\r\n *   style: style_object,\r\n *   hash: true,\r\n *   transformRequest: (url, resourceType)=> {\r\n *     if(resourceType == 'Source' && url.startsWith('http://myHost')) {\r\n *       return {\r\n *        url: url.replace('http', 'https'),\r\n *        headers: { 'my-custom-header': true},\r\n *        credentials: 'include'  // Include cookies for cross-origin requests\r\n *      }\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * });\r\n * @see [Display a map](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/)\r\n */\r\nclass Map extends Camera {\r\n    style: Style;\r\n    painter: Painter;\r\n\r\n    _container: HTMLElement;\r\n    _missingCSSContainer: HTMLElement;\r\n    _canvasContainer: HTMLElement;\r\n    _controlContainer: HTMLElement;\r\n    _controlPositions: {[string]: HTMLElement};\r\n    _interactive: ?boolean;\r\n    _showTileBoundaries: ?boolean;\r\n    _showCollisionBoxes: ?boolean;\r\n    _showOverdrawInspector: boolean;\r\n    _repaint: ?boolean;\r\n    _vertices: ?boolean;\r\n    _canvas: HTMLCanvasElement;\r\n    _transformRequest: RequestTransformFunction;\r\n    _maxTileCacheSize: number;\r\n    _frameId: any;\r\n    _styleDirty: ?boolean;\r\n    _sourcesDirty: ?boolean;\r\n    _placementDirty: ?boolean;\r\n    _loaded: boolean;\r\n    _trackResize: boolean;\r\n    _preserveDrawingBuffer: boolean;\r\n    _failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat: boolean;\r\n    _refreshExpiredTiles: boolean;\r\n    _hash: Hash;\r\n    _delegatedListeners: any;\r\n    _fadeDuration: number;\r\n    _crossFadingFactor: number;\r\n\r\n    scrollZoom: ScrollZoomHandler;\r\n    boxZoom: BoxZoomHandler;\r\n    dragRotate: DragRotateHandler;\r\n    dragPan: DragPanHandler;\r\n    keyboard: KeyboardHandler;\r\n    doubleClickZoom: DoubleClickZoomHandler;\r\n    touchZoomRotate: TouchZoomRotateHandler;\r\n\r\n    constructor(options: MapOptions) {\r\n        options = util.extend({}, defaultOptions, options);\r\n\r\n        if (options.minZoom != null && options.maxZoom != null && options.minZoom > options.maxZoom) {\r\n            throw new Error(`maxZoom must be greater than minZoom`);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        const transform = new Transform(options.minZoom, options.maxZoom, options.renderWorldCopies);\r\n        super(transform, options);\r\n\r\n        this._interactive = options.interactive;\r\n        this._maxTileCacheSize = options.maxTileCacheSize;\r\n        this._failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat = options.failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat;\r\n        this._preserveDrawingBuffer = options.preserveDrawingBuffer;\r\n        this._trackResize = options.trackResize;\r\n        this._bearingSnap = options.bearingSnap;\r\n        this._refreshExpiredTiles = options.refreshExpiredTiles;\r\n        this._fadeDuration = options.fadeDuration;\r\n        this._crossFadingFactor = 1;\r\n\r\n        const transformRequestFn = options.transformRequest;\r\n        this._transformRequest = transformRequestFn ?

a button that uses the browser's geolocation\r\n * API to locate the user on the map.\r\n *\r\n * Not all browsers support geolocation,\r\n * and some users may disable the feature. Geolocation support for modern\r\n * browsers including Chrome requires sites to be served over HTTPS. If\r\n * geolocation support is not available, the GeolocateControl will not\r\n * be visible.\r\n *\r\n * The zoom level applied will depend on the accuracy of the geolocation provided by the device.\r\n *\r\n * The GeolocateControl has two modes. If `trackUserLocation` is `false` (default) the control acts as a button, which when pressed will set the map's camera to target the user location. If the user moves, the map won't update. This is most suited for the desktop. If `trackUserLocation` is `true` the control acts as a toggle button that when active the user's location is actively monitored for changes. In this mode the GeolocateControl has three states:\r\n * * active - the map's camera automatically updates as the user's location changes, keeping the location dot in the center.\r\n * * passive - the user's location dot automatically updates, but the map's camera does not.\r\n * * disabled\r\n *\r\n * @implements {IControl}\r\n * @param {Object} [options]\r\n * @param {Object} [options.positionOptions={enableHighAccuracy: false, timeout: 6000}] A Geolocation API [PositionOptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PositionOptions) object.\r\n * @param {Object} [options.fitBoundsOptions={maxZoom: 15}] A [`fitBounds`](#Map#fitBounds) options object to use when the map is panned and zoomed to the user's location. The default is to use a `maxZoom` of 15 to limit how far the map will zoom in for very accurate locations.\r\n * @param {Object} [options.trackUserLocation=false] If `true` the Geolocate Control becomes a toggle button and when active the map will receive updates to the user's location as it changes.\r\n * @param {Object} [options.showUserLocation=true] By default a dot will be shown on the map at the user's location. Set to `false` to disable.\r\n *\r\n * @example\r\n * map.addControl(new mapboxgl.GeolocateControl({\r\n *     positionOptions: {\r\n *         enableHighAccuracy: true\r\n *     },\r\n *     trackUserLocation: true\r\n * }));\r\n */\r\nclass GeolocateControl extends Evented {\r\n    _map: Map;\r\n    options: any;\r\n    _container: HTMLElement;\r\n    _dotElement: HTMLElement;\r\n
