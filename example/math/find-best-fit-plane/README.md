# How to find the best fint plane from 3d points on 3d tile?

Customer Request.
I would like the functionality to draw a polygon on 3d-tiles, then we must best fit a plane to the vertices of this polygon, and then find the heading & pitch of the planes normal.

Application Logic
User draws a polygon in 3d tile.
Application will calculate the best fitting plane for the drawn polygon.
Next, the application will calculate the normal vector of the found fitting plane.
The application will calculate the heading and pitch of a normal vector.
