# Simple CesiumJS Camera Controlling similar to Google Street View

## 1 when a user clicks a point, the camera should move to that point

##### a. orientation of camera should be the same when moving

##### b. height of camera to the ground of the 3D tile should be the same when moving

## 2. Cesium.ScreenSpaceEventType.LEFT_DOWN should be same as Google Street View

#### so that the screen does not keep tilting to the side when user is looking around.

#### This can be seen in Cesium when the user holds SHIFT+LEFT_DOWN to rotate around
